# Javascript features

&nbsp;

## Summary

Javascript is a world of its own. It has evolved from a browser only scripting language to a programming language of its own, capable of running both clent side and server-side. Javascript is now being used as the programming language of choice not only in browsers but servers, native apps, desktop apps and even TVs. Lets look at how Javascript is different from other programming languages.

## High level

## Single Threaded

## Garbage collected

## Interpreted

Prgramming languages like Java, C are compiled into bytecode. The machine reads this bytecode and executes them. Javascript on the other hand was designed to be interpreted by the browser. You just write code directly and the browser just interprets and executes it. It is also called as just in time compilation.

## Prototype based

## Dynamically typed

Javascript is a weakly/dynamically typed language. And that means you dont have to specify the intended data type of a variable. It can hold any type of value unlike Java where you need to specify the data type.

## First class functions

A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Multi purpose

I think the killer feature of JavaScript has been that it is being used everywhere these days. Web, Native, TVs etc.

## Multi Paradigm

## With non blocking event loop
