Hey, I am **Sreeram Padmanabhan**. Some friends call me Siri. I am a Web Developer and this is my personal website/tech blog/gallery.

I like to think I am an artist of the Web because I believe web developers have a great responsibility of architecting a virtual world. It takes a great deal of creativity to do that. I live in London and am involved in one of the leading banks here.

I travel regularly and have so far covered 12 countries in 2 continents. I believe small things done over a long period of time yield the greatest results.

I am also active on instagram at [sreeramofficial](https://instagram.com/sreeramofficial).

## What this site is about

This is my personal website. Every bit of it is built using scratch using open source software. Its also a technical cum personal blog where I write things I found interesting or amazing, places I travelled, things I want to remember etc. If it helps someone else, well n good.
