Hey, I am **Sreeram Padmanabhan**. Some friends call me Siri. I am a Web Developer cum trainer and this is my personal website/tech blog/gallery.

I like to think I am an artist of the Web because I believe web developers have a great responsibility of architecting a virtual world. It takes a great deal of creativity to do that. I live in Berlin and am involved in one of the leading companies there.

I travel regularly and have so far covered 12 countries in 2 continents.

I am also active on instagram at [@sreeramofficial](https://instagram.com/sreeramofficial).

## What this site is about

Some time in 2018, I wanted to create the perfect web boilerplate project. So I started creating a template from scratch wth everything configured. All I need to do is change some configurables and a full fledged Progressive web app, rendered server side, optimised for performance, optimised for search engines, with payment gateway integrated, with continous integration and continous deployment integrated, with unit testing, remote cross browser testing in browserstack, integration testing in Cypress, Puppeteer integrated and what not? And I used it to create my personal website. Every bit of it is built using scratch using open source software. I write things I found interesting or amazing, places I visited, things I want to remember etc. If it helps someone else, I'd be happy.
