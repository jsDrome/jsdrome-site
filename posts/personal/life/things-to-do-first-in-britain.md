# Things to do post moving to the UK

&nbsp;

## Travel card

As soon as I landed in the Airport, I got the oyster card from the underground and topped it up for 15£. Travel from Heathrow to Liverpool street costs about 5-6£ I believe.
Now that I have the monzo card, I dont use oyster anymore.

## Sim Card

I got one of the cheapest phone connections which has served me well over the past 3 years. Cost me about 10£ to get a new sim card. But I could have got it online for free.

## Accommodation

London is cheaper in the east and thats where I landed in the beginning back in 2016. If I visit London again, I'd probably use spareroom to find a room share somewhere if I am single or Zoopla or Rightmove to find a house. In the 3 years I was there, I made a few connections which I'd use. This is a costly affair. I'd also make sure there is a proper rental agreement, a thorough walkthrough of the house, and photographs before moving in because I have had some bad experiences with some agencies who tried to scam me. I'd also make sure that the deposit goes into the Deposit Protection Scheme.

## Collecting the BRP

I collected mine from Reading the first time in 2016 as I had given my employer's UK address. The second time I went to the UK, I had given a tentative place of stay in London where my friends stayed.

## Getting the Naltional Insurance number

I contacted Jobcentre plus who sent me a form and I sent them back to get an NI number.

## Submitting the P46 Form

I submitted the P46 form to my employer to set the correct tax code.

## Bank account

Online banks are abundant in the UK. I got HSBC before that. Then got Monzo, Revolut, Transferwise and Starling. I will compare these in a future post.

## UTR number

Register with HMRC for getting the Unique Tax Reference Number. This is used to file tax returns.

## Filing Self Assessment every year

Froms required for this are:

 - P60 - Like Form 16 in India: A report of all the tax paid in the fiscal year
 - P11D - Any benefits received
 - P45 - Letter of leave from country

## Registering with the local Practice

Find the nearest GP and book an appointment if you want to be treated for free. Or it costs a fortune.
