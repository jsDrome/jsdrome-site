# My professional life so far

### 2005

My story unfolds in 2005 when my friends at school created this online forum for my class which created a buzz. It was used for all the class gossips. They also were making money using Google Adsense. Me, although being new to computers, always wanted to do something like that. Thats when I found Blogger. I didnt have to know anything technical to use Blogger. I also enrolled in Adsense but never really got paid because my blog wasnt very popular.

### 2007-11

It wasnt until 2007/8 when I took part in an online treasure hunt (something like a quiz where you couldnt just search google to find the answer) and I did so amazingly well that I wanted to build it for my own college. Thats how I took the baby steps into the ocean of Web Development. I started with HTML, creating webpages with Dreamweaver and softwares like that, encrypting them using a software with the answer as the password, and deployed it somewhere. I dont remember what happened after that but it did not succeed. So I decided to do it properly and decided get in touch with the guys who created the online treasure hunt. Unfortunately, they did not help me much but said I could achieve it with PHP. I had absolutely no idea what that was back then. So I set out to learn PHP. I learnt some basic HTML, CSS, and PHP and ended up creating the online treasure hunt for my college. I took the help of my school friends to deploy it. And voila, it was received well by all. Around 500 people registered and played the game of 40 levels and somebody won. Not sure if I rewarded them, but it was a huge success. All the while not knowing this would eventually become my career. Then, I started to conduct this game independently on my own. They were all reasonably good successes.

I used to attend Web Development contests throughout my final 2 years of college which I'd mostly win. Good old days when I used to memorize tags and syntax. My friends always wanted to be my partner because they were assured of half of the prize money. Lol. They took turns to be my partner.

In 2011, I was asked to create the website for raics.org - an IEEE conference on the Recent Advancements in Intelligent Computing Systems.

### 2011-12

In June 2011, I joined Mistallianz, a startup where I worked as a PHP Developer for 6 months. Towards the end of 2011, I started and failed in creating my own start up. An online platform where people can create their portfolio/resume/website and recruiters can search and find them. I ended it abrupty because it wouldnt have succeeded against LinkedIn. I wasnt fully convinced with it. Also, I had to move to a different city for a new job with Wipro Technologies. That seemed a better bet.

### 2012-16

I had hated computer science all the while. But through some devine intervention, I did well in the 3 month rigorous training at Wipro where I found Unix and C very interesting. I finished in the top 5 for a guy who didnt like computer science 3 months ago. Although I was a C developer there, I found my own opportunity in Web Development in a different location for a different client. I worked with developers from Apple for 3 years from offshore.

### 2016-19

I moved to London in 2016 to work for Lloyds Bank and I have been working here since then. The work here has been challenging. Suddenly, from a Junior developer in offshore, I was put into a role where had to take major decisions for the Statements team as a Frontend Lead, a page used by millions in the UK every single day. That was daunting.

To give you an example, we had to create one SPA, the Statement page, used by 3 banks - Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and Halifax, 3 channels - the public, branch employees and costomer care, for 3 kinds of users - Developer, Retail and Commercial, 3 form factors - Desktop, Mobile and Tablet. Thats 81 combinations which needed to be created and tested for something to go live. So we had to come up with robust code, build, pipeline, testing and rollback strategies. Add to that making everything accessible. Every line of code had to be done to scale. So far, I seem to have done a good job and I am proud to have been a good problem solver here.

### 2020

I am back in India. Its time for my next journey. I have found a new job in Germany and will be moving there next.
