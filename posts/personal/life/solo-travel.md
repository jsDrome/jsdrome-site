## Summary

In 2016, I set out my journey out of India. This post looks at the various places I went and the time I spent there.

## London

I moved to the UK in 2016 for work. It was exciting. I was concerned about a lot of things back then. But it turned out okay. I came back to India not only richer in money, but richer in knowledge and experience. I lived in London.

If I were to describe it in short, its where the most creative people in the world live. Its a mini world. Lot of color and taste. Lot of crime. Old city and metropolitan. Nice people. Cheaper in the east. Hippy hackney. Underground travel, beautiful parks, museums, stadiums. Fast paced life. Weed. Banks, events. I miss London.

## Paris

I spent 3 days in Paris. Visited the Effiel tower, Disney Land Paris, English channel visa ferry, Calais, Dover, Stayed at Hilton Hotels near an airport I dont remember which, drive around the city centre, Grand Palais, Louvre museum, River cruise. Eventful. Beautiful city cleaner than London.

## Edinburgh

Although Scotland is not a country per se, It has a slightly different culture than London. Its in the north, their slangs are different and its not as fast as London. I spent 4 days in Edinburgh. I didnt travel outside of Edinburgh because I wanted to imbibe in its culture. Met a lot of people at the Haystack Hostel. Its a small city. You can cover it entirely in about 3-4 days. Authurs seat comes to mind because I loved it. Duke's place was just cute and beautiful. Carlton Hill, Edinburgh Castle, The Royal mile, Edinburgh Waverley, The Botanical garden. It was a pleasant stay. Worth going again I'd say. This time would live there for longer and cover many other places like Inverness.

## Amsterdam

The 2 things that come to my mind are the canals and the Red light ditrict. Its amazing how the city is divided into concentric circles of canals. The buildings are beautiful which is unique to Amsterdam. I tried smoking 1 weed from a friend which did nothing. Not a fan of weed. The Red light district lits up in the night. It was not by accident that Amsterdam is called the sex capital of Europe. I also went to Kuekenhof. Although it was towards the end of May, I was not fortunate enough to see the tulip fields.
