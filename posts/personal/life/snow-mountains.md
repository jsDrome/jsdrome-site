# The coolest thing I've seen from an Airplane

&nbsp;

I was on my way to London from Thiruvananthapuram in an Emirates Airlines.

In the first leg of the journey I saw the deserts of Dubai but didnt get a good enough picture. I'd upload it but it would ruin this post.

After a 2 hour transit at Dubai, I was lucky enough to get a window seat in the London leg of the journey.

A few minutes into it, flying at 38,000 ft, I was treated to this simply breathtaking view of snow capped mountains. It felt like I was on top of Antarctica or something. I checked the in flight GPS and it was somewhere on top of Turkey. I was astonished how a desert just a few minutes ago turned into snow. I made sure I got a picture of it. Scroll slowly.
