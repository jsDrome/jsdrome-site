Come with me now my son, as we break through the bars of your Earthly confinement, travelling through time and space..  In the 6 known dimensions.. Your powers, will far exceed those of mortal man.. It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. Rather let your leadership, stir others to..

In this next year, we shall examine, the human heart. It is more fragile than your own..  For the past 2 years.. As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy, we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun. Source of your strength and nourishment and, cause of our eventual destruction. The planet Krypton, my son, your home, as it was..

This year, we shall examine the various concepts of immortatility, and their basis in actual fact..  The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies, is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you. Study them well my son, and learn from them.. Over the past 12 years, we have reasoned out logical judgments.. By the time we return to the confines of your galaxy, 12 of your years will have passed.. For this reason among others, I have chosen Earth, for you..

It is now time for you to rejoin your new world, and to serve its, collective humanity. Live as one of them Kal-El, to discover where your strength and your power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride, of your special heritage. They can be a great people Kal-El they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.
