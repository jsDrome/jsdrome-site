# The view from my home balcony in Trivandrum

&nbsp;

Seen above is the view from my home in Trivandrum. On a typical sunny day, it looks as if the heavens descented on earth.

Trivandrum is an amazing city. In my opinion its one of the best cities in the world to live because of many reasons:

## Whats best in Trivandrum?

 - Its costal. Kovalam and Varkala are renowned tourist spots and I plan to get a beachfront property some day.

 - Its lush green. Kerala is known as the God's own country because its on the western side of the Western Ghats and that means it receives ample rainfall. If you take a trip on a train, you will have one of the best experiences ever.

 - The people are educated here. Its the capital city of Kerala which has almost a 100% literacy rate, the best in the country. And that means, its has a better quality of life there. Most importantly, less crime and corruption.

 - Its not a metropolitan yet. And that means its still clean (infact its amazingly clean), less pollution, corruption, poverty and other issues. Although Trivandrum is on its way to becoming a metropolitan. Hopefully the people there will keep it clean in every sense.

 - It has a warm climate. Its not too hot or cold in any time of the year, it receives ample rainfall. Every once in a while I could escape to Ponmudi which is a hill station.

 - Its touristy. Kovalam, Varkala, Shankumugham, Sree Padmanabhan Swamy temple, Ponmudi, the Museums, the Zoo, and many other tourist spots.

## What could improve

 - Some roads need to improve.

 - Public transport needs to improve.

 - Crime rate, corruption on the rise and need to be checked.

 - Some auto drivers ruining the reputaion of others.
